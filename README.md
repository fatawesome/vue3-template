# Vue3 + SSR + HMR + TS template.
I made it mainly for internal usage, so use carefully.

Contributions are welcome :)

### TODO 
- clean `package.json` from useless scripts;
- prepare production build scripts;
- intergrate prettier;
- intergrate Webpack Module Federation (atleast so that shell itself can benefit from HMR).
